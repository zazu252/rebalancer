## How It Works üîç

Rebalancer operates through a series of steps:

1. **Scheduled Scans**: The system runs at set intervals, checking your wallet for current balances.
2. **Deviation Calculation**: It calculates how much your current balances deviate from your target ratios.
3. **Swap Execution**: If deviations exceed a certain threshold, the system interacts with Uniswap smart contracts to execute swaps and restore your target weights.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Node.js**: The backend is built using Node.js for efficient server-side operations.
- **Infura API**: Connects to the Ethereum network for wallet interactions.
- **Uniswap V3**: Utilizes Uniswap smart contracts for executing trades.
- **Express**: Serves as the web framework for the application.
